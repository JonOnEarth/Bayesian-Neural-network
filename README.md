## Papers
This implementation and code based on the paper: weight uncertainty of Neural network
## Codes and contents are heavily inspired by

- https://github.com/cpark321/uncertainty-deep-learning several methods for BNN

- https://joshfeldman.net/ml/2018/12/17/WeightUncertainty.html

- http://krasserm.github.io/2019/03/14/bayesian-neural-networks/
